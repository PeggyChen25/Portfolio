                                    <h2>Graduate School</h2>
									<p>Pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics at the University of Washington has been one of the most rewarding and transformative chapters of my life. From the moment I joined the program, I felt a deep sense of belonging as a Dub ‚Äî surrounded by brilliant classmates, inspiring faculty, and a community that shares my passion for solving real-world problems with data.</p>

									<p>Academically, the program has been both rigorous and exciting. I‚Äôve built hands-on expertise in predictive modeling, data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, working with tools like Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. Courses like Multivariate Regression, Time Series Forecasting, and Text Analytics not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me how to think critically and creatively with data.</p>

									<p>One of the most meaningful highlights was competing in

									<p>Beyond the classroom, UW opened doors for exploration and connection. I participated in the program‚Äôs

These experiences, alongside late-night study sessions, brainstorming with teammates, and cheering on the Huskies, made me feel deeply rooted in the UW community.</p>


									<p>Looking back, UW has not only equipped me with the tools to thrive as a data-driven professional ‚Äî it has also given me a home, a network, and lifelong memories that I will carry forward with pride.</p>

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<p>Over the past few years, I‚Äôve developed a passion for using data to drive meaningful change across industries. As a Process Analyst at the Economic Development Bureau in Taichung, Taiwan, I optimized government workflows and boosted decision-making accuracy by building Tableau dashboards, automating risk tracking systems, and applying SQL and Python to uncover critical market risks. One of my proudest achievements was helping reduce potential risk exposure by 10% through a logistic regression model that safeguarded

									<p>Before that, at Sheraton Hydropower Engineering Co., I worked as a Sales Analyst in partnership with Philips, providing sustainable energy solutions to over 300 clients. There, I increased lead-to-conversion rates by 10%, improved quarterly sales, and used R and Python to deliver insights that strengthened both risk management and promotional strategies ‚Äî including forecasting and mitigating risks for the

									<p>What‚Äôs been most rewarding is seeing the real-world impact of analytics ‚Äî from helping a city of 2.8 million people grow its industries to promoting renewable energy adoption ‚Äî and collaborating across teams to turn data into actionable outcomes. These experiences have shaped my growth as an adaptable, impact-driven analyst eager to keep learning and contributing.</p>

									<h2>Undergraduate School</h2>
									<p>I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Risk Management and Insurance at Feng Chia University, one of Taiwan‚Äôs most respected institutions for business education. During this time, I built a strong foundation in understanding financial risk, insurance principles, actuarial analysis, and business strategy. I learned how to assess, quantify, and manage various types of risk, from market and credit risk to operational and catastrophe risk.</p>
									<p>Beyond the classroom, my time at Feng Chia shaped me personally ‚Äî I developed a sharp analytical mindset, a love for teamwork, and a deep appreciation for how risk management plays a crucial role in protecting people, businesses, and communities. Whether working on case studies, group projects, or campus activities, I grew not only as a student but as a collaborator and problem-solver. Looking back, my undergraduate journey set the stage for my later transition into data analytics, giving me the tools to bridge business insights with technical solutions.
